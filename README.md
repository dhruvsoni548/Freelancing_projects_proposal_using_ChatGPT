# Freelancing_projects_proposal_using_ChatGPT
In this project I have used my previous knowledge of web scrapping to scrap website like "Freelancer" to get a html file. Then using Beautiful soup I generated a csv file which had project name and project description. Then I used ChatGPT api to get the best proposal for that project then generated a csv file of that proposal data.
